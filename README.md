# Yeka Organics Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow one of the installation options below:

### 1. For users with the correct React version:

Ensure that your React version matches the required one for this project. You can check your React version by running:

```bash
npm list react

```

If you have the correct version, you can install dependencies normally:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. For users without the correct React version but want to proceed:
If you're using an incorrect version of React, but want to proceed with the installation anyway, use the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will bypass version compatibility issues. However, please be aware that this may cause issues during development or production depending on the dependencies involved.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. For users who want to use --force:
If you must install dependencies despite potential conflicts (this may cause issues and is not recommended unless absolutely necessary), use the --force option:

```bash
npm install --force
```
Proceeding with this option may result in broken dependencies or unexpected behavior, so use it only if you understand the potential risks.

If you have the correct version, you can install dependencies normally:

```bash
npm install
```

If you have the correct version, you can install dependencies normally:

```

After installing dependencies, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
